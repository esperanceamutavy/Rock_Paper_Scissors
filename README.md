This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game implemented in Python, where you play against the computer. 
The game will prompt you to enter your choice of either "Rock," "Paper," or "Scissors," and the computer will randomly select one of the three options. 
The game then compares your choice with the computer's to determine the winner.

Rock beats Scissors.
Scissors beat Paper.
Paper beats Rock.
If both the user and computer choose the same option, the game ends in a tie.
